# RC Receiver

The Board is a customized Receiver that uses nRF24l01 to control any Project such as a Car, Plane, SpiderBot e.t.c. The only condition is that the Transmitting device must use a Programmable MCU and a nRF24l01 (Master Mode). For this, I have already designed a custom PCB for a Transmitter.
